abstract: 'The purpose of the current review is to examine three frequently employed
  types of assessment: (a) standardized tests, (b) screening, and (c) behavioral assessment.
  The aims are to advocate for best practices with evidence-based assessments (EBAs)
  and provide guidance to implement EBAs within applied settings. Information regarding
  the current best practices, customary field-based practices, and recommendations
  for improved practices are provided for each assessment type. Further, a framework
  is provided for using standardized tests, screening, and behavioral assessment within
  best practices to determine student intervention needs and potential for disability.'
