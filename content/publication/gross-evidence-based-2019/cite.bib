 abstract = {The purpose of the current review is to examine three frequently employed types of assessment: (a) standardized tests, (b) screening, and (c) behavioral assessment. The aims are to advocate for best practices with evidence-based assessments (EBAs) and provide guidance to implement EBAs within applied settings. Information regarding the current best practices, customary field-based practices, and recommendations for improved practices are provided for each assessment type. Further, a framework is provided for using standardized tests, screening, and behavioral assessment within best practices to determine student intervention needs and potential for disability.},
