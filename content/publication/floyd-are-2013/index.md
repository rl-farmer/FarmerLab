abstract: Psychometric g is the largest, most general, and most predictive factor
  underlying individual differences across cognitive tasks included in intelligence
  tests. Given that the overall score from intelligence tests is interpreted as an
  index of psychometric g, we examined the correlations between general factors extracted
  from individually administered intelligence tests using data from five samples of
  children and adolescents (n = 83 to n = 200) who completed at least two of six intelligence
  tests. We found strong correlations between the general factors indicating that
  these intelligence tests measure the same construct, psychometric g. A total of
  three general-factor correlations exceeded .95, but two other correlations were
  somewhat lower (.89 and .92). In addition, specific ability factors correlated highly
  across tests in most (but not all) cases. School psychologists and other professionals
  should know that psychometric g and several specific abilities are measured in remarkably
  similar ways across a wide array of intelligence tests.
