abstract: Intelligence tests produce composite scores that are interpreted as indexes
  of psychometric g. Like all measures, general intelligence composites are not pure
  representations of their intended construct, so it is important to evaluate the
  score characteristics that affect accuracy in measurement. In this study, we identified
  three characteristics of general intelligence composite scores that vary across
  intelligence tests, including the number, the g loadings, and the heterogeneity
  of contributing subtests. We created 77 composite scores to test the influence of
  these characteristics in measuring psychometric g. Internal consistency reliability
  coefficients and g loadings were calculated for the composites. General intelligence
  composites most accurately index psychometric using numerous highly g-loaded subtests.
  Considering confidence intervals, composites stemming from four subtests produced
  scores as highly g loaded as those composites that stem from additional subtests.
  Discussion focuses on what methods should be use to optimally measure psychometric
  g and how standards in constructing composites should balance psychometric and practical
  considerations.
