abstract: The most global score yielded by intelligence tests, IQs, are supported
  by substantial validity evidence and have historically been central to the identification
  of intellectual disabilities, learning disabilities, and giftedness. This study
  examined the extent to which IQs measure the ability they target, psychometric g.
  Data from three samples of children and adolescents (Ns = 200, 150, and 135) who
  completed varying pairs of individually administered, multidimensional intelligence
  tests were analyzed using a joint confirmatory factor analysis to generate correlations
  between IQs and general factors representing psychometric g. The resulting values,
  expressed as g loadings, for the six IQs ranged from .88 to .95 (M = .92). The accuracy
  of IQs in measuring psychometric g, the meaning of reliable specific ability variance
  in IQs not accounted for by psychometric g, and the use of IQs in schools and related
  settings are discussed.
