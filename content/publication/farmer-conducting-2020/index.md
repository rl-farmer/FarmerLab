abstract: Decision-makers in school psychology are presently engaged in the process
  of determining how to, if possible, move forward with conducting mandated psychoeducational
  evaluations of students in schools during the pandemic. Whereas prominent organizations
  within the profession (e.g., American Psychological Association, National Association
  of School Psychologists) have issued guidance and encouraged practitioners to delay
  testing, it is not clear whether that is a viable option in every jurisdiction.
  Accordingly, professionals are now considering the potential use of telehealth platforms
  to conduct assessments, in some form, as we move forward and deal with this crisis.
  The goal of this brief commentary is to raise some provisional limitations associated
  with the use of telehealth to conduct psychological assessments that we believe
  will have to be considered as use of these platforms is debated. Recommendations
  for professional practice are also provided.
