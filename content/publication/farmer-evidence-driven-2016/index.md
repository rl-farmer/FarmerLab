abstract: School-based practitioners are to implement and report functional behavior
  assessments (FBAs) that are consistent with both the research literature and the
  law, both federal and state. However, the literature regarding how best to document
  the FBA process is underdeveloped. A review of applied behavior analytic and school
  psychology literature as well as legislation and case law informs FBA reporting
  practices regarding (a) required content, (b) graphing of data, (c) organization
  of reports, and (d) clarity of language. The purpose of FBA reports is discussed,
  and this discussion explicitly informs the use of a solution-focused approach to
  improve clarity in report writing. Recommendations for best practices in FBA report
  writing are provided, and future research needs are highlighted.
