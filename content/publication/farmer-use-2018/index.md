abstract: 'Intellectual disability (ID) is a disabling condition associated with deficits
  in intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior. Those involved in the assessment
  of children and adolescents with ID should consider recent changes in diagnostic
  criteria for the condition, as well as best practices in assessment. The American
  Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities provides a multidimensional
  framework of human functioning encompassing five domains: intellectual abilities,
  adaptive behavior, health, participation, and context of the individual. Those engaged
  in assessment of ID should be aware of psychometric considerations when they are
  selecting and completing cognitive ability test batteries. The chapter reviews some
  controversies associated with ID assessment and offers informed opinions to guide
  the application of research to practice. The accurate assessment of ID is of utmost
  importance, and thus clinicians should act purposefully to ensure that their test
  results are valid. When a clinician is considering ID as a diagnosis, a number of
  factors may confound the assessment process. These factors fit into two broad categories:
  competing hypotheses regarding the appropriate diagnosis, and construct-irrelevant
  influences that reduce the validity of the assessment results. In addition to considering
  competing hypotheses and construct-irrelevant influences, clinicians should consider
  the influence of culture and language. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all
