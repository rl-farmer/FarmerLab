abstract: The representativeness, recency, and size of norm samples strongly influence
  the accuracy of inferences drawn from their scores. Inadequate norm samples may
  lead to inflated or deflated scores for individuals and poorer prediction of developmental
  and academic outcomes. The purpose of this study was to apply Kranzler and Floyd’s
  method for estimating norm block sample sizes via a review of the most prominent,
  individually administered intelligence tests. A rigorous, double-coding process
  was used to obtain these estimated sample sizes for 17 intelligence tests (10 full-length
  multidimensional tests, 4 nonverbal intelligence tests, and 3 brief intelligence
  tests). Overall, 47% of the tests failed to meet the minimum standard of at least
  30 participants per norm block across age groups, and estimated norm block sizes
  were smallest for elementary school–age children. These results can inform intelligence
  test selection by practitioners and researchers, and they should be considered by
  test publishers when developing, revising, and reporting information about their
  tests.
