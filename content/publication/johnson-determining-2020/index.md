abstract: Repeated measurements of student ability (i.e., progressing monitoring)
  is an essential element of informed decision-making when adjusting instruction.
  An important characteristic of progress monitoring measures is frequent administration
  to identify areas of concern and to evaluate academic growth. The purpose of this
  study was to determine if STAR Math is sensitive to small incremental growth across
  a semester. Within two southern school districts, 114 fifth grade students’ progress
  monitoring data were collected weekly, and a latent growth curve was used to estimate
  students’ change in math ability. Results indicated STAR Math is sensitive to small
  incremental growth, with a statistically significant and positive slope, suggesting
  students using STAR Math showed improvement in ability over the semester.
