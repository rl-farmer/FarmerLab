abstract: The purpose of this study was to further examine the factor structure of
  the Huber Inventory of Trainee Self-Efficacy (HITS), a measure of school psychology
  trainee self-efficacy. Lockwood et al. (2017, Psychol. Sch., Vol. 54, pp. 655â€“670)
  extant data set, collected from 520 school psychology trainees, was utilized. Four
  measurement models were examined for model fit and factor loadings. Of the four
  models, a bifactor model with a single latent general self-efficacy (GSE) and latent
  domain-specific factors (i.e., Multidimensional Assessment Skills, Counseling Skills,
  Professional Interpersonal Skills, and Research Skills) was the most parsimonious.
  However, standardized loadings indicated that all practice-related items loaded
  more significantly onto GSE than their domain-specific factors, indicating the utility
  of GSE for practice-related skills. Of note, the Research Skills factor displayed
  greater domain-specific loadings than general loadings. These findings suggest that
  GSE may be the best indicator of trainee self-efficacy, though a two-factor model
  that represents practical skills versus research skills may also be appropriate.
  Additionally, reliability scores indicate that subscale interpretation may also
  be reasonable. Limitations, implications for trainers of school psychologists, and
  for future research directions are discussed.
