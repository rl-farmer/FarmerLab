abstract: Many prominent intelligence tests (e.g., Wechsler Intelligence Scale for
  Children, Fifth Edition [WISC-V] and Reynolds Intellectual Abilities Scale, Second
  Edition [RIAS-2]) offer methods for computing subtest- and composite-level difference
  scores. This study uses data provided in the technical manual of the WISC-V and
  RIAS-2 to calculate reliability coefficients for difference scores. Subtest-level
  difference score reliabilities range from 0.59 to 0.99 for the RIAS-2 and from 0.53
  to 0.87 for the WISC-V. Composite-level difference score reliabilities generally
  range from 0.23 to 0.95 for the RIAS-2 and from 0.36 to 0.87 for the WISC-V. Emphasis
  is placed on comparisons recommended by test publishers and a discussion of minimum
  requirements for interpretation of differences scores is provided.
