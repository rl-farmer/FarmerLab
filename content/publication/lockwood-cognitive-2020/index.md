abstract: Given significant changes to legislation, practice, research, and instrumentation,
  the purpose of this study was to examine the course on cognitive assessment in school
  psychology programs and to describe the (a) structure, (b) instructional strategies,
  (c) content, and (d) interpretative strategies taught to school psychology graduate
  students. One hundred and twenty-seven instructors were surveyed, and results suggest
  that over the last 20 years support for teaching cognitive assessment has decreased
  while the content and instructional strategies have remained largely the same. Results
  of this study also indicate that the interpretation strategies taught to rely heavily
  on Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory and related interpretive frameworks (e.g., cross-battery
  assessment). Additionally, instructors are placing greater emphasis on multicultural
  sensitivity/culturally and linguistically diverse assessment than in previous decades.
  Implications for future research, training, and practice are discussed.
