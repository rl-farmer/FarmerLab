abstract: As the Vineland Scales are among the most relevant, well-developed, and
  popular measures of adaptive behavior available for use, this study evaluated the
  factor structure and dimensionality of the Vineland-3 Comprehensive Interview Form.
  Drawing data from 2,560 participants in the norming sample, exploratory and confirmatory
  factor analyses were completed across two independent samples from four age-groups
  ranging from preschool-age children to adults. Results from exploratory factor analysis
  revealed evidence for a unidimensional model across age-groups, but results from
  confirmatory factor analysis indicated that multidimensional models were better
  fitting than unidimensional models for each age-group. Discussion focuses on whether
  the Vineland-3 Comprehensive Interview Form is truly a unidimensional or multidimensional
  measure.
